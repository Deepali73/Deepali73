## 🔍 About Me

I didn’t begin with machine learning or web development.  
I began with curiosity — the kind that questions,  
**“How does this actually work under the hood?”**

That spark led me through Linux terminals, AI models, backend logic, and frontend design — and it still fuels everything I build.

I’m currently exploring the intersection of **AI, system automation, and full-stack web applications**, with hands-on experience in deploying containerized apps using **Docker**, automating workflows with **Jenkins**, and orchestrating services with **Kubernetes**.
